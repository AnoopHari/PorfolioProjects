# Online Shopping Data Analysis

This project is centered around a thorough exploration of an online shopping dataset, employing R programming to unveil essential insights and trends. By conducting in-depth analyses across customer behavior, product preferences, geographic spending patterns, coupon impacts, temporal trends, and performance metrics, this study uses visualization tools such as ggplot and plotly. These visualizations unravel correlations, seasonal trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs) present within the dataset. The primary goal is to furnish a comprehensive comprehension of customer spending behaviors, product categories, and the nuanced influence of discounts and GST on transaction values. The findings aim to offer actionable insights, crucial for informed decision-making strategies in the realm of e-commerce. Furthermore, an interactive visualization has been included using ggplotly, accessible through the Rpubs report for a more dynamic exploration of the data.
