This visualization is a part of my ongoing ggplot project aimed at recreating a significant scatter plot published online in The Economist in 2011. The focus of this endeavor is to replicate and analyze the relationship between Corruption and Human Development, as highlighted in the original publication. Through ggplot2 in R, I am meticulously reconstructing the scatter plot that elucidates the correlation between Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and Human Development Index (HDI). The objective is to understand and visualize the patterns, trends, and potential correlations observed in the data, offering insights into the relationship between corruption levels and the overall development of various countries.
