# Title : Recreation of "The Economist" Publication's Scatterplot: Corruption and Human Development

This project aims to recreate a scatterplot visualization featured in The Economist's 2011 publication focusing on the correlation between 
Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and Human Development Index (HDI). Leveraging R's ggplot2 library, this endeavor involves meticulous data 
visualization techniques to replicate and analyze the relationship between corruption levels and human development across various countries. 
The project specifically utilizes ggplot2 for plot creation, employing data preprocessing techniques to enhance readability and reduce label 
congestion for improved insights. The resulting visualization emphasizes the intersection between corruption perception and human development,
aiming to provide a clearer representation of their correlation.
