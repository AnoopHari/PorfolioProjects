# Online Shopping Data Analysis

This project revolves around exploring an online shopping dataset to extract valuable insights and patterns. Using R programming, it delves into various aspects, including customer behavior analysis, product trends, geographical spending patterns, coupon impacts, temporal trends, and performance metrics. Leveraging visualization tools like ggplot and plotly, the analysis uncovers correlations, seasonal trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs) within the dataset. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer spending habits, product categories, and the influence of discounts and GST on transaction values, offering actionable insights for strategic decision-making in the e-commerce domain.
