# Electric Vehicle Data Project

The objective of this analysis is to explore and derive insights from a comprehensive electric vehicle dataset encompassing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The aim is to understand manufacturing trends, vehicle attributes, pricing dynamics, and geographical distribution within Washington State. Key objectives include investigating Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility trends, understanding electric range distribution, analyzing Base Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), examining geographical distribution, and exploring preferences among electric utilities.

Steps Taken in the Analysis:

1. Data Preparation and Overview:

- Loaded the dataset and examined its structure using str() and head() functions.

- Checked for missing values and imputed them with appropriate values.

2. CAFV Eligibility and Trends:

- Explored the percentage of vehicles categorized as CAFV eligible.

- Investigated trends in CAFV eligibility across different vehicle types and model years.

3. Electric Range Distribution:

- Analyzed the distribution of electric ranges among BEVs and PHEVs using boxplots.

- Explored electric range variations over different model years for BEVs and PHEVs.

4. Base MSRP Analysis:

- Explored the range and distribution of Base MSRP across different vehicle types and models using boxplots.

- Examined the correlation between Base MSRP and CAFV eligibility or electric range.

5. Geographical Insights:

- Investigated the geographical distribution of electric vehicles across counties and cities in Washington State.

- Focused on the top 20 counties with the highest number of vehicle registrations.

6. Utility Provider Preferences:

- Explored preferences for electric utilities among registered electric vehicles.

Conclusion:

Summarized key findings related to manufacturing trends, vehicle eligibility, popular makes, electric range, pricing dynamics, correlations, registration distribution, and utility preferences, providing insights into the evolving landscape of electric vehicles.
